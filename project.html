        <h2> The Effect of Working from Home on Productivity. </h2>
    
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>The aim of my project will be to examine the relationship between working from home and levels of labour productivity. Throughout the pandemic, many industries changed from being office-based to encouraging their workers to work from home. The changes in the level of people working from home can be seen below. </p>

  <div class="chart" id="chart10">
      <script>
        var myChart10 = "workingfromhomefreq.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart10', myChart10);
      </script>
  </div>

   <p> After the Coronavirus pandemic hit, the only category of working from home to increase was ‘mainly’, indicating that the proportion of people using home as their primary place of work increased. All other categories decreased around 2019, again pointing towards a major change in the percentage of those working from home. </p>

   <p>This being the case, I was curious to see whether the level of economy-wide productivity changed at all. It could have improved as the time spent commuting was reduced, or it may have decreased as there is unlikely to be the same moderation of work at home than there is in an office. Perhaps there will be no difference at all, as the proportion of those who are now working from home make up such a small proportion of the labour force as a whole it won’t change much. </p>
