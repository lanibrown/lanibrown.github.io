        <h2> The Effect of Working from Home on Productivity within the US, UK and New Zealand (NZ). </h2>
    
<!-- PROJECT BEGINS -->    

  <p>The aim of my project is to examine the relationship between working from home and levels of labour productivity, through the lens of three specified countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many industries changed from being office-based to encouraging their workers to work from home. The changes in the level of people working from home in the UK, US and NZ can be seen below. </p>

   <p>In the UK after the pandemic hit, the proportion of people using home as their primary place of work increased. The US data taken from a survey completed by the PEW research centre shows a similar pattern. While this data was not available in New Zealand, there was data showing when the severity of the pandemic was higher, more people worked from home. </p>

<p> This chart displaying the percentage change of output per hour in the UK and US consists of data from different sources layered into the same graph. The UK data comes from an ONS API, and the US data from FRED data hosted on GitHub. Both are easily found, and this chart should be very repeatable. Unfortunately, data on New Zealand was unavailable. As the UK data is sourced from an API it will update automatically as more data is available, however the FRED data will not. </p>    

<p> The trends in both countries seemed to be a gradual decline in percentage change of output per hour, however this was strongly reversed in early 2020 for the US. The cyclical nature of the percentage change indicates that it has something to do with the effect of the numerous lockdowns, however it is difficult to know whether this is due to the working from home orders or other factors.</p>

<p>The main reason the US was included in this project was because there wasn’t a furlough scheme. As a result, many more people were counted as unemployed and therefore not included in productivity statistics such as total output per worker. This will hopefully overcome the issue of identifying the effect of working from home in the UK and NZ.</p>

               <!--Chart 5 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart5">

    var myChart5 = "3countrycomparison.json";

<div class="chart" id="chart6">

 </div>    

<p> The productivity in the US increasing may be seen as an indication that working from home does increase productivity, however there are several other factors that may contribute to this, such as the low productivity workers potentially being the first to be made unemployed, increasing average productivity. Interestingly, this method of measuring productivity – output per worker – conflicts with the data on output per hour for the US. Research would have to be done as to why this is – perhaps more hours were worked. </p>

<p> The productivity data available on OECD was only yearly. To overcome this, I used the OECD's forecasted productivity levels, which are quarterly and use both collected data and a predictive model considering world events and individual economic climates. All data in these two charts are from OECD sources hosted on GitHub and should therefore be comparable. Unfortunately, API resources for the OECD are limited and didn’t include this forecasted data so it is not automated and would have to be updated manually.</p>

<p> To tackle this issue with country comparison data, I have compiled a graph comparing the actual non-forecasted productivity index for different sectors of the UK. The data was found on ONS then filtered manually to the most relevant. This shows that the sector you are in makes a large difference to the productivity changes. </p>

<p> Those most able to work from home are in the services industry. When compared to the others, the trend is more universal across the individual sectors. Manufacturing, retail/hospitality, and agriculture are very variable across the period, whereas services, with a few exceptions, follows a more distinctive trend. What I infer from this is that the lockdowns had less of a radical effect on the service industry due to the ability to work from home.</p>

<p> However, the trend does show the productivity index slowly decreasing. Given the similarity of New Zealand to the UK, I assume this result would also be similar. This indicates that the average productivity is lower during periods of more people working from home than in the office, however there is not enough evidence for a solid causal link. The contradictory nature of the US data in relation to productivity changes reinforces this.</p>

<p> To take this research further, data would have to be collected on the number of people on furlough so they could be discounted from any productivity figures. Alternatively, specific productivity data would need to be collected and categorised as working from home or in office. In recent months it would be even more difficult to isolate the effect as many people have switched to ‘hybrid working’ - spending some days at home and some in the office.</p>
